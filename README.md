# Oakland Soft-Story Map

A simple interactive map of potential soft-story buildings in Oakland

Forked from Code for America's HouseFacts site: http://housefacts.codeforamerica.org/SF/

This was a quicky, one-off to get the data out there after the Napa earthquake. It's an extension of ongoing work on the issue at OpenOakland, living here: https://github.com/openoakland/soft-story-buildings

Done by @daguar and @migurski

## Install

This is a static HTML / CSS / JS application. It relies on a tiled geojson version
of the data hosted on data.codeforamerica.org
